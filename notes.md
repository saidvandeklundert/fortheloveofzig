```zig
/// The *specifier* has several options for types:
/// - `x` and `X`: output numeric value in hexadecimal notation
/// - `s`:
///   - for pointer-to-many and C pointers of u8, print as a C-string using zero-termination
///   - for slices of u8, print the entire slice as a string without zero-termination
/// - `e`: output floating point value in scientific notation
/// - `d`: output numeric value in decimal notation
/// - `b`: output integer value in binary notation
/// - `o`: output integer value in octal notation
/// - `c`: output integer as an ASCII character. Integer type must have 8 bits at max.
/// - `u`: output integer as an UTF-8 sequence. Integer type must have 21 bits at max.
/// - `?`: output optional value as either the unwrapped value, or `null`; may be followed by a format specifier for the underlying value.
/// - `!`: output error union value as either the unwrapped value, or the formatted error value; may be followed by a format specifier for the underlying value.
/// - `*`: output the address of the value instead of the value itself.
/// - `any`: output a value of any type using its default format.
